Search TV Shows: 

In this App we can search our Favorite Tv shows. 
Based on the Search text our App will list the Tv shows that near matches the search text.

We are using express and superagent npm Modules to make an Api Request based on the Search Text and create server 
and Angular Js to handle the Url Request and dependencies between controllers

#History
now, to track and list all the previous searches made by the user we are using FireBase (NOSQL) database. using one of the npm modules angular-uuid we are making sure that each search is ID'd with the unique ID.
